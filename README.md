### PHP
A PHP version which is easier to maintain, but requires a little familiarity with PHP.  
[PHP Version 200707](https://github.com/ChrispyWood/mavboot/blob/master/___versions/mavboot_php_200707.zip)

### Git
A github project which includes the build files for theming Bootstrap.  This requires SASS, familiarity with Node Package Manager, commandline environments, PHP, HTML, CSS.  
[mavboot on GitHub](https://github.com/ChrispyWood/mavboot/)  

NOTE: The _/includes/00-top.php file loads the CSS with a version number in the repository, this versioning should be removed in production (by deleting '?v=<?php echo rand(0,30000000);?>')
